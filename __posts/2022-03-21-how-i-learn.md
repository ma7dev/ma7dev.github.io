## Requirements
- iPad
- Laptop/PC
- Google Drive/DropBox/any cloud storage

## Consume the content
When I read from an article, PDF, or any text-based resource, I follow the following rules:
- Use two highlighting colors (orange and green) and alternate between them to separate ideas.
- After reading for some time or feeling that I have lost or might lose track of what I have read before, I come back and write marginal notes (in red) to describe the general idea for each highlighted section.
- After completing reading the content, I revisit my notes and try to have a solid understanding of the content, and add more marginal notes with a different color (blue).
- Re-write my notes and general ideas into a piece of paper to understand the flow of ideas (just focus on important things and ignore details that aren't important)


## Document ideas
After I complete consuming the content, I move my notes to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to have them backed up in Markdown and organized for future reference. I try to refactor my notes every month or so.

## Things that I use
I use my iPad to write notes by hand and read PDFs. However, I have a different setup to organize my workflow:
- [GoodNotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/): to write notes from scratch.
    - I use dark, square-style sheet
    - I use three colors (yellow=main content, red and blue=side notes)

- [Notability](https://notability.com/): to read and highlight on PDF.
    - I use three highlighting colors (orange and green = highlighting ideas, and blue = for extremely important things or weird stuff that I want to look into later)
    - I use two colors for marginal notes(red = during reading, and blue = after reading)

Both of them are synced to Google Drive and I use [insync](https://www.insynchq.com/) to sync the documents created in both GoodNotes and Notability to my PC/Laptop.

In addition, I use the following to do certain things:
- [Mathpix](https://mathpix.com/): take a screenshot on pdf or hand-written equations to turn them into LaTeX equations (basically to be added to LaTeX or Markdown document)
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/): for cloud storage
- [insync](https://www.insynchq.com/): to automatically backup my stuff between different machines
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/): to manage pdf files
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/app/): to manage tasks and reading content
- [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/): to manage online content (smart bookmarks)
- [Super Simple Highlighter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-simple-highlighter/hhlhjgianpocpoppaiihmlpgcoehlhio?hl=en): to highlight on the web
