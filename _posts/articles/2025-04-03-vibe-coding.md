The last few days, I've been vibe coding with Cursor to build a simple web game to be part of the [#vibejam](https://x.com/hashtag/vibejam) event. Due to my prior experience in using Cursor where I vibe code but I get stuck doing vibe debugging, I have decided to find a better way to vibe code. Here is my experience in three parts: Using Memory Bank, using devlogs, and 

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is an approach where you focus on your creative flow and let the AI help guide your implementation. It's about having a general direction and iteratively building something while maintaining your creative energy.

## Using Memory Bank for Better Context

I have came across [CoderOne]()'s video, [10x your Cursor Workflow with Memory Bank](), where he referenced [Cline]()'s approach to improve the agent's behavior by providing a [Memory Bank]().

## Vibe Debugging: The Challenge

When vibe coding, you often hit roadblocks when debugging. The flow gets interrupted and you find yourself diving into technical details rather than maintaining that creative energy.

## My Solution: Structured Vibe Sessions

I've developed a system that works well for me:

1. Start with a clear goal but flexible implementation
2. Set time limits for vibe coding sessions
3. Use Memory Bank to maintain context
4. Document as you go with devlogs
5. Separate coding and debugging sessions

This has dramatically improved my productivity and enjoyment of the coding process.
